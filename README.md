# Computational Fluid Dynamics

Here is a collection of MATLAB code that might be of some help in solving various types of computational fluid dynamics 
problems. I wrote them during graduate school while pursuing an M.S. in Mechanical Engineering and functionally the codes produce valid results; however, I am sure there is room for improvement from an efficiency standpoint.

## Diffusion PDE

Two parallel plates extended to infinity are a distance of \mathit{h} = 4 \mathit{cm} apart. The fluid within the plates has a kinematic viscosity of \mathit{\nu} = 0.000217 \mathit{m^{2}/s} and density of 800 \mathit{kg/m^{3}}.

The governing equation is simplified as:

\frac{\partial u }{\partial t} = \nu \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2}

## Convection-Diffusion PDE

## Elliptic PDE

## Vorticity-Stream Function Method
